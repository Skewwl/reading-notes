## React Docs - lists and keys

- What does .map() return?

A new array with each element being the result of the callback function.

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

Use the .map() operator to return a new array but with each element in the array encompassed by <li> nodes. Then return the variable assigned to the new array in curly braces inside of a <ul> node.

- Each list item needs a unique ____.

Key.

JSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys. A key helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.
