# Psychological Saftey 

- What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

The behaviors that create psychological safety are conversational turn-taking, empathy and the establishment of a relationship. 

- Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

The first thing that comes to mind is when I was a kid playing on my soccer teams and always having a blast and joking around. We were very competative and our friendship with eachother made us push eacheother to be better so that we could win more games. Conversely, I worked at a restaurant years ago where the owner did a lot of cocaine and he would yell at everyone to the point where we wouldn't say things to him that he needed to know about (to make the operation run smooth) because we feared he would yell at us.

- What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

These teams pump put the best results and optimise their performance. As well, they create a dynamic and fun place to work.
