### How the Web Works

 - The client *(computer)* __requests__ from the server *(internet)* and gets a __response__.
 - Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.
 - Order of oporations:
   - The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on.
   - The browser requests a message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.
   - If the server approves, then it starts sending the website's files to the browser.
   - The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page.

### What is JavaScript

 - JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to a website and can eventually be used to store data, create games, and make elaborate animations.
 - A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement. 
 - An ARRAY allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. Ex: let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
Refer to each member of the array like this: myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.
