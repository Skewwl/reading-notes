## Video and Audio Content

- Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

Origianlly it was available through 3rd party sources and there were secrurity and accessibilty issues but now we have the ability to use video and audio with native capabilities within HTML.

- Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
  
The source creates a path to the video you want to use and the controls attribute allows us to stop and start the video and adjust the volume.
  
- Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
  
Fallback content will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element. It allows the user to understand or view the content in another way.
  
- Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
  
One upon a time there were two friends who wanted to be the same but never coud be. One of them, Audio, was only two dimensional and the other, Video was three dimensional. When they were kids they were kept in the dark and the world could not see them for who they really were. Now that they are older the world they live in accepts them more and so they find themselves playing to gether in their World Wide Web.
