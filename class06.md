## How I explained REST to my brother

- Who is Roy Fielding?

He helped write the first web servers and http protocol.

- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because we haven't had universal verbs that can speak to all of the machines. 

- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Their protocol is all about applying verbs to nouns. like getting the representation of a resource.

- What does a GET do?

Retrieves data from another system.

- What does a POST do?

Adds data to another system.

- What does PUT do?

Replaces data to another system.

- What does PATCH do?
