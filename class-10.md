## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

- Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors come with an error mesage and cause the program to not run at all. Logic errors are more difficult because the eroor message might not pop up and take a lot more mental effort to fix.

- List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

I just got a NaN error when trying to add value to the footer row of our tables in lab-06. I couldn't fix it I eventually just quit, deleted all of my code and tried again in a few hours. Syntax errors are my favorite because I know exactly what line to look at and they typically dont lead to more and more errors.

- How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

This topic doesn't influence me a lot any way becasue running into bumps and overcoming them is basically the name of the game and even though it kills me sometimes there is nothing but more of it in any software dev job I might land myself in.

##The JavaScript Debugger.

- How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that freezes you code a certain spots so that you can verify where you code is running amuck. 

- Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint is the point where the debugger stops executing code so that the developer can verify that everything is running smoothly up until that point.

- What is the call stack?

The call stack is the code that was executed to get you to the break point.
