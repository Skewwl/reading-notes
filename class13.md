## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

A good way to think about it is that: REST API's invoke CRUD operations.

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

Bring in all of your dependencies. Create all of your routes. Start route (crud) callbacks by linking API to database. Make sure you have databse receptivity. Formulate a response to deliver to the frontend.
