## sql vs nosql (Reading)

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

#### SQL
- Relational DB
- Table based schema  
- Vertically scalable by increasing power
- Uses SQL to define & manipulate the data
- Better for complex query environment

#### NoSQL
- Non-relational or distributed DB
- No standard schema
- Horizontally scalable by increasing servers
- Varying syntax per DB
- Better for hierarchical data storage
 	 
- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

A complex, query intensive DB.

- Give a real world example.

For a highly transactional based application, like ecommerce.

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Hierarchical data storage.

- Give a real world example.

For an application based on document storage, like a news publisher.

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL!

- Which type of database is best for scalability?

They are both scalable in different ways but NoSQL is 'better' because it can always expand horizontally.

- What does SQL stand for?

Structured query language.

- What is a relational database?

A relational DB organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table. Data is typically structured across multiple tables, which can be joined together via keywords to send response data.

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Table structures are found in a realtional DB.

- What is a ‘schema’?

The organization or structure of a DB.

- What is a NoSQL database?

A database that allows collection of data in a flexible manner that fits the developers material.

- How does it work?

It takes in key value pairs and documents that we are able to subdivide.

- What is inside of a MongoDB database?

A collection of data.

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB, because there is no set schema, just a collection that builds as you set it up.

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

There is no set outline so being introduced to a new NoSQL DB will have a greater learning curve.
