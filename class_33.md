## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

- Role-based access control restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

Share some examples of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

- Management role scope: it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage. 
- Management role group: you can add and remove members. Could add and delete members of the access group.
- Management role: these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group. Might allow the group any of the crud functionality to keep information objects relevant.
- Management role assignment: this links a role to a role group. 

What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- Managing and auditing network access is essential to information security. Access can and should be granted on a need-to-know basis. A good RBAC system should reduce administrative work and IT support, maximize operational efficiency, and improve compliance.
