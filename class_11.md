## Event Driven Programming

- What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

EventEmitter!

- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

It allows the object to act soley by using logic stored within itself. It is also makes things happen automatically without having to add another expression every time you need the specific event logic to run.

- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

On the backend events could be useful if you had them set up so that additional actions fired off if the incoming request did something specific that required additional action. Maybe you are running an email service and someone wants to reply all with attachments. Without getting too into the weeds I could imagine that these specific add ons could benefit greatly from an event triggering. For example, an attachment unzips.
