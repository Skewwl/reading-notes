# SQL

SQL is its own programming language that allows us to interact with relational databases. SELECT allows is to specify the column to query and WHERE allows us to administer parameters and home in on any particular rows. The JOIN command allows us to tack on data from an external table. INSERT INTO allows us to add data while UPDATE allows us to add rows to our table. DELETE FROM allows us to delete a table entorely or its rows while DROP TABLE eliminates everything that the table ever meant to anybody. CREATE TABLE allows us to create an entire table and specify all of its columns while ALTER TABLE allows us to add, remove, or modify columns that already exist.
