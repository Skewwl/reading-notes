## Domain Modeling

- Explain why we need domain modeling.

We need domain modeling for selecting a problem area of code and describing the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. This helps to verify and validate a spesific problem. 

## HTML Table Basics

- Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Becuase they are sixed according to their content at times, they reduce accessibility for visually impaired, and this can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.

- List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
  
  Table head - <th> The table head represents important information that is reperesented by the data points below. 
  Table row - <tr> The rows house all of the other elements inside of them and are used to create new lines.
  Table data - <td> Each individual cell of the table.
  
## Introducing Constructors

- What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  
  A constructor is a term that allows you to make more objects based off of previous objects with less work.
  
- How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
  
  This will be combined with new to bind another objects properties to the new object.
  
## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

- Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
     NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question.
